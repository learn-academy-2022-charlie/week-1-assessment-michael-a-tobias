# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement is a function that performs an action based on the results of a Boolean statement. You create a decision tree that checks if a condition is true or false. If true, the statement will perform a programmed action. If it is not true, then it will perform a different programmed action.

  Researched answer: My research shows that my answer was correct.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is the software used by developers to collaborate and share code. GitHub is the website that allows a developer to interact with the remote files in a GUI. For my coding bootcamp, I would regularly pull repositories from GitHub and push my local changes back up.

  Researched answer: Git is software used by developers on their local machine to manage multiple versions of files. GitHub is a website that serves as a cloud repository for git. GitHub users can manage remote files using a GUI.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: The operators that will return a Boolean value are those that will return a true/false statement. That would be relational operators (>, <, >=, <=), logical operators (&&, ||, !), and equivalent operators (==, ===).

  Researched answer: I forgot modulo (%). I've commonly used modulo to determine if a value is even or not.
  Operators that return a Boolean value are often used in conditional statements.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Index is the location of a character in a string or an element in an array. The measure of an index begins at the 0 position with the first character or element. A value is a piece of data that is assigned meaning.

  Researched answer: My research shows my answer is correct.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is an element used in a for loop that describes how the function would repeat itself.

  Researched answer: I think I'm correct according to my research, but I'm not sure "element" is the correct word. Some JavaScript words have specific JS definitions and could also mean a general, English definition. In this instance, I mean that iteration is a part of a for loop.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: A proper pair programming technique involves two more more programmers. There would be one driver whose role would be to do the typing of the actual code for the pair programmers. The other programmer(s) would be the navigators. Their job would be to guide the driver in what to type, look over any mistakes, research potential solutions or blockers, and generally think in a larger scope outside of what is directly in front of the driver. In my coding bootcamp, we would use pair programming daily. We would pair of with randomly chosen students and we took turns being the driver and navigator. There were plenty of times where I was driving and could not see the forest for the trees, and my navigator found a solution in a way that I was not even thinking of.

  Researched answer: My research shows my answer to be correct.
